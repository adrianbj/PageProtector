```
// all optional, except "page_protected", which must be set to true/false
// if setting it to false, the other options are not relevant

$options = array(
    "page_protected" => true,
    "children_protected" => true,
    "roles" => array("role1", "role2"),
    "message_override" => "My custom login message",
    "prohibited_message" => "My custom prohibited access message"
);
